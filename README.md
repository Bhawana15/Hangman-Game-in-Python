Code for the Hangman Game in Python.
Used Python library - random

# Game Description
The name of some animals is fed into the system. The system chooses one of the animals randomly using the random library. The system will give the total number of letters in the name of the animal and asks the player to guess the name of the animal chosen by the system. The system will give the player few chances so that the player enters one letter(which he feels, can be a letter in the name chosen by the system) at a time. If he ends up guessing the correct name in the given number of chances, he wins the game, otherwise losses it.
